I am currently a Ph.D. student in Information Sciences at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://ischool.illinois.edu/), advised by [Dr. Madelyn Sanfilippo](https://madelynsanfilippo.com/). Before transitioning into the tech field and starting my doctoral program, I work at the Brazilian Attorney General’s Office. That legal background serves as a context for my research on the intersection of Law and Machine Learning, making me curious about fairness in ML models, Legal NLP, and AI Governance.
